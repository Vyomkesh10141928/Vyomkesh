        <p id="p1">Birdwatching, or birding, is a form of wildlife observation in which the observation of birds is a
            recreational activity or citizen science. It can be done with the naked eye, through a visual enhancement
            device like binoculars and telescopes, by listening for bird sounds,or by watching public webcams.

            Birdwatching often involves a significant auditory component, as many bird species are more easily detected
            and identified by ear than by eye. Most birdwatchers pursue this activity for recreational or social
            reasons, unlike ornithologists, who engage in the study of birds using formal scientific methods.Vyomkesh
            Buch is one such birder from surat who thinks that any place in the world is a great spot to watch
            birds.He got intrested in birding during lockdown(May 2020) by trying to take photograph of birds with
            mobile.He got introduced to <a href="https://ebird.org/india/home" style="text-decoration: none;"><b
                    style="color: green;">Ebird</b></a> by exploring different websites to learn more about birds.He
            admires all species but his favorite birds include woodpeckers,warblers,owls etc.He wants to see 1000
            species
            from India.He likes to bird with others but also birds alone sometimes.He is fortunate to have few trees
            near his home which provide nesting for many species of birds.He has observed internal fighting of Asian
            Koels,Breeding ofJungle Babblers,Tailorbirds and Bulbul all in one year.Along with birding,he also records
            bird songs and does some nature
            photography.He also makes websites and sometimes apps(by block coding).His current tally for Gujarat is 113
            species of birds,and is hoping to increase it by birding more.He has a target to bird 1000 hours in 2021
            alone.He also observes animals and reptiles.His current list of observations is not much but he is keen on
            increasing the list.He is keen on spotting birds anywhere in the world wether he is in car or on foot.
